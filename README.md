# HighlighterSwift 1.0.0

This library provides a Swift wrapper for the popular [Highlight.js]() code highlighting utility.

It is a more up-to-date version of Juan Pablo Illanesâ€™ [Highlightr]() and relies heavily upon code from that project, which is now no longer maintained. It makes use of Highlight.js 9, but the most recent release, as of June 2021, is version 11. The use of version 9 is no longer supported, so I have made use of 10.7.3, and hope to update the library to version 11.x in due course.
